# BikeSharing

-  For this analysis, tripduration column is changed using pandas from an integer to a datatime data type. Then using the converted data type, a set of different vicualizations have been created using Tableau Public app. 
### Different viz were: 
- Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- number of bikes trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Two suggested visualizations are:
- Pie  charts are a good way to summarize what gender type is using how many bikesharing rides. 
- bar charts are also a great way to summarize the user and their bikesharing activity.
